# Author

This is a desktop application for users to author content without the need for systems. This implements ELMS:LN "HAX" and book outlining capabilities in a local, offline capable desktop application. This is intended for authoring material in a space that's separate from where courses are deployed and allows for a greater form of remix and reuse of material.
